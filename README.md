VisionDiff – Image Change Detection System

VisionDiff is a lightweight Python-based system that detects differences between before and after images using classical computer-vision techniques.
It automatically highlights the changed regions and exports the annotated image.

Computes difference using:

Grayscale conversion

Absolute difference

Thresholding

Noise filtering

Contour detection

Draws bounding boxes around changes

Saves output as:
X~3.jpg

No deep learning required

Fast and accurate for static scene changes
